Machine Learning Course Coding Challenge Problem:
Uses streamlit to interact with the model and give predictions according to the selected inputs. The main aim of this project is to learn how to deploy a Machine Learning model using Streamlit, and thus create intuition to do the same with a regular frontend webpage.
